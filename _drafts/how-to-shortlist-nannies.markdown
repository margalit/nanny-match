So, you have placed an ad with Nanny Match and the applications are coming in. Depending on the quality of the job, you could receive up to fifty applications. Follow these steps to narrow down your options and find the right person for your family.

Remember:
* You don't need to contact every applicant
* It's a good idea to contact those who stand out as soon as possible

### Step 1: Flag out-standing applications

* Does the carer have experience with the appropriate age-group?
* Can you see any cultural, value-based or personality similarities between the carer and your family?
* Are you seeking a long term carer? Look for applications that indicate long term availability.
* Remember that [First Aid Certificates](http://wonderwomanchildren.com/arlo/events/8-childcare-first-aid-hltaid004/) can be renewed.

### Step 2: Phone interviews

* Can you tell me a little bit about your most recent experience with children?
* What are you looking for in your new job?
* What other commitments do you have?
* Can I contact your referees?

### Step 3: Reference Check

* Tell me about the work this carer did for you?
* How did they help you and your children?
* Is there anything I need to be aware of?

### Step 4: Interviews

See [this post](http://nannymatch.com.au/blog/meetandgreet/) to learn more about holding an interview in your home.
