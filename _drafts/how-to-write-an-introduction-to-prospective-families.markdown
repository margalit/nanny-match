It can be difficult to write about yourself. But never fear! Be yourself, use clear language and good grammar. Write about those little things that make you a great employee. Our families receive anywhere between 2 and 50 applicants, so your writing will help you to stand out from the crowd.

## Example 1: Short, sweet and honest

I recently left my job as an architect to focus on starting a small fashion label. I'm looking for a rewarding part-time gig while I get my business up and running.

I love reading, dancing, craft, bike riding and walks, and I'm not ashamed to say I've been to the Museum about 10 times this month.

I speak some Auslan and I am happy to obtain a WWCC should I find the right family to work with.

Currently, I look after an almost 5-yr old boy and almost 2-yr old in Fitzroy 2-3 days per week. I have cared for 0-11 year olds in Brisbane, Shanghai and Melbourne and have a great deal of experience caring for my 2-yr old twin nephews. I am still in contact with my most recent family as we catch up for coffees and play dates.

## Example 2: Professional and succinct

I have recently moved from Perth to Melbourne to study a Master of Environment at The University of Melbourne. I am a happy, patient and energetic person.

I have a valid drivers licence, my own car and would be happy to help out with housework, cooking or whatever else is required to help make your life easier.

For over five years while I was completing my engineering degree I was a regular nanny/babysitter for over 5 families on my street and I have a 7 & 8-year-old brother and sister who I have actively cared for since I was 15. I am very comfortable with kids and love to keep them entertained and engaged with games, music, craft and other activities - not to mention adventures in the community including local parks and libraries.

## Example 3: Personal and adventurous

I'm from the sunny Whitsundays in North Queensland, and I always carry a little of that sunshine with me.

Childhood is a time full of wonder and firsts. I feel lucky to experience the joy of discovery everyday with children. I put an emphasis on understanding the child's perspective and motivation in order for us to build a relationship based in mutual respect. I'm looking for a family that shares those values. Children remind me to be present each day, and to let go of my assumptions about the world, which is a pretty special gift.

I am looking for regular or casual babysitting.

I would guess I was about 12 when I started offering to babysit, it couldn't have been long after I started reading "the babysitters club", and I was pretty eager to join that club. Working with children has been part of my life ever since. I've worked as a private nanny, as well as a disability support assistant for a child with developmental delays, and in private play-therapy sessions. I have also worked in two independent community childcare settings, as well as tried my hand as playgroup leader and a children's cooking workshop facilitator (for primary school aged children). I am most experienced with children from 12 months - 6 years old.
