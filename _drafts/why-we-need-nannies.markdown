**1. We need working parents**


**2. We can't get into childcare**

Flexible, high quality, affordable childcare is essential if families are to balance the demands of work and caring for young children.[Adam Bandt's childcare report](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/melbourne/pages/6880/attachments/original/1452052790/!2015_Childcare_Survey_Report.pdf?1452052790) findings include: 

* 92% of centres had a waiting list for childcare places
* The average reported waiting list time for 0-2 year old children was 10.1 months
* 50% of centres had no vacancies for 0-2 year olds, with only 19% of centres having places available on all days
* 19% of centres had no vacancies for 3-4 year olds, with only 43% of centres having places available on all days
* Nearly 6 out of 10 centres would offer more places if they had the resources available to expand their physical space

3. Our working hours don't match school or kinder hours

4. We have less family support (Working grandparents, relocated)
