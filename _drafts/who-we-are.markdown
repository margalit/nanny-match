Nanny Match has five+ years worth of experience in finding valuable carers who provide nanny and babysitting services. We started out by meeting families for a cuppa and interviewing prospective nannies over a cold-drip in Collingwood. We have made hundreds of long-lasting matches and have a unique perspective on what makes a great carer. We am particularly fond of helping mums return to work with confidence and giving couples the opportunity to reconnect over a date-night or two.

Nanny Match is a community of makers, doers and educators. When we are not working with children, you can find us making art, designing, crafting, hiking, teaching and learning. We believe in quality over quantity and better care for our fellow human beings, young, old and in-between.

We have carefully curated our network of experienced nannies and babysitters. We have grown to a 500+ strong community.
