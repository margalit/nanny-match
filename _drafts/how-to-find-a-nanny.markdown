Navigating the nanny world can be a confusing experience for first time families. 

* How much does a nanny cost? 
* What can I expect from a nanny? 
* How will I know my child will be safe with a nanny? 
* How do I find a nanny? 
* How do I pay a nanny? 

A private nanny search can take new parents weeks, if not months. To save time, your first step is to determine if nanny care is a viable option for your family. 

The spread and amount of hours that you require will determine the type of employment you will need to offer, the quality of your applicants and the longevity of your engagement. The hours and employment will determine the cost and therefore the viability of nanny care as a reliable child care option to your family. 

**What days and hours do I need?** 
If you need less than 5 hours per week, or if you are looking for one-off care for less than 3 months, you might choose to engage with a contractor. 

If you require ongoing care at a total of 5 hours or more per week, this likely reflects an employer/employee relationship. You might like to consider: 

a) employing the nanny directly, or;
b) hiring a nanny through an employment agency.  


Hiring a contractor: 
* A nanny cannot simply claim to be a contractor. It is the nature of the work and the engagement that determines whether the worker is a contractor or an employee. It’s important to clarify your needs from the beginning so you can determine your responsibilities, costs and the associated administration. It’s also important to keep tabs on the engagement as a contractor may start working more often and on a more regular basis, indicating a change to an employee/employer arrangement. 


* The nanny works for herself and is responsible for her own employment. Expect rates of at least $35 per hour for a contractor in Australia. This will include the nanny’s base rate, loading or leave, superannuation, insurance and WorkCover. A rate of $35 per hour can reflect a base rate of just $23 per hour—close to minimum wage in Australia. 


* The nanny is responsible for managing her own PAYG tax, superannuation payments and leave entitlements. 


* As her own employer, the nanny has more power to decide when to take work and when to decline work, and the conditions set for her work.


* It's very difficult to keep someone in a role that offers less than 6 hours each shift. You may need to consider extending your hours to find the right person and keep them on board long term. If you extend your hours to more than 5 hours per week you will gain the benefits of finding an experienced person who is going to last—you will also need to consider your employer obligations. 


## Hiring an employee: direct or through an agency 

### Employing a nanny directly

* Expect a timeline of at least 4 weeks to recruit a new nanny and set up employment. Consider allowing time to interview candidates in person and set up trial shifts. 


* As the employer you are responsible for the worker, their wage, superannuation, PAYG tax, WorkCover, leave entitlements and employment agreements. 


* As the employer you are responsible for maintaining and checking Working with Children Checks. 


* We recommend obtaining a National Police Check and a HTLAID004 First Aid Certificate before commencing employment. 


* As the employer you are responsible for adhering to our National Employment Standards, tax and superannuation law. 


* As the employer you are responsible for outlining the appropriate agreements and working conditions. You will find that most private nannies are not aware of their rights as a worker and this can lead to misunderstandings around rates and employment benefits. 


* Expect a base rate of $23 per hour + 9.5% superannuation, + 1.8% WorkCover insurance. You will also need to consider insurance costs and vehicle insurance costs if your nanny is to drive. You will need to consider how to manage PAYG tax and time sheets, and any costs related to administration. The minimum base rate + these added costs come to a minimum of $26 per hour. Should you choose to use a recruitment service to recruit a nanny to employ directly you can expect placement fees between $499 and $4999.

### Agency-employed nannies

* Expect a timeline of at least 1 week to find and start with your new nanny.


* As the employer the agency is responsible for the worker, their wage, superannuation, PAYG tax, WorkCover, leave entitlements and employment agreements. The agency is responsible for all costs associated with the employment.


* As the employer the agency is responsible for maintaining all checks and certificates. Each agency will require different checks, depending on their policies and their insurance cover. At a basic level, each agency nanny should hold a valid National Police Check, a Victorian Working with Children Check and a first aid certificate. 


* As the employer the agency is responsible for adhering to National Employment Standards, tax and superannuation law. 


* Expect a base rate of $23 per hour + 9.5% superannuation, + 1.8% WorkCover insurance + insurance, agency and payroll fees. The minimum base rate + these added costs comes to a minimum of $32 per hour.
