Navigating the nanny world can be a confusing experience for first time families. As traditional child care becomes more scarce and costly, more parents are turning to nanny care as a solution.

Nanny care can be a wonderful experience for parents, children and nannies. Families can enjoy flexible, one-on-one care, less illness and a unique extension to their circle of trust. Nannies enjoy working closely with children and finding reward in helping them  grow and learn.   

The key differences to traditional childcare and nanny care include: 

* **Compatibility factor**—inviting someone to work in your home introduces a new layer to the parent/carer relationship. It's important that both parties feel 100% comfortable with each other before engaging. 

* **Employer obligations**—in most cases, the nanny could be deemed an employee for superannuation and WorkCover purposes. In these circumstances, either the family or an agency will need to take on employer obligations, administration and costs. 

* **Cost**—unlike childcare, where many families share the cost of care, engaging with one carer means the cost is likely to be higher than traditional care. Some families may be eligible for the in-home care package—more information can be found here. 

The first step is to determine if nanny care is a viable option for your family. To do this, you will need to: 

1. Work out the spread and amount of hours to determine how likely it is that you will find (and keep) a nanny.

The spread and amount of hours will determine how much time and effort it's going to take to find a nanny. A general rule is the more hours on offer each shift, the more interest you will receive, and you have a higher chance of keeping your nanny. 

2. Work out your employer obligations by considering the spread and amount of hours, ATO and Fair Work guidelines. 

3. Work out the cost and administration associated with the type of employment arrangement required. 


**What days and hours do I need?** 

If you need less than 5 hours per week, or if you are looking for one-off care for less than 3 months, you might choose to engage with a contractor. You will need to check your requirements against the ATO's contractor vs. employee tool. 

If you require ongoing care at a total of 5 hours or more per week, this likely reflects an employer/employee relationship for superannuation and WorkCover purposes. Again, you will need to check your needs against the ATO's contractor vs. employee tool. 

You might like to consider: 

a) employing the nanny directly, or;
b) hiring a nanny through an employment agency.

## Employing a nanny

### Option 1: Agency-employed nannies

* Expect a timeline of at least 2 weeks to find and start with your new nanny.

* As the employer, the agency is responsible for all costs, administration and liabilities associated with the employment arrangement, including the nanny's wage, superannuation, PAYG tax, WorkCover, leave entitlements and employment agreements. 

* As the employer the agency is responsible for maintaining all checks and certificates. Each agency will require different checks, depending on their policies and their insurance cover. At a basic level, each agency nanny should hold a valid National Police Check, a Victorian Working with Children Check and a first aid certificate. 

* As the employer the agency is responsible for adhering to National Employment Standards, tax and superannuation law. 

* Depending on the type of employment you can expect a base rate of $23 per hour + 9.5% superannuation, + 1.8% WorkCover insurance + insurance, agency and payroll fees. The minimum base rate + these added costs comes to a minimum of $32 per hour and can reach up to $50 an hour.


### Option 2: employing a nanny directly

* Expect a timeline of at least 4 weeks to recruit a new nanny and set up employment. Consider allowing time to interview candidates in person and set up trial shifts. 


* As the employer you are responsible for the worker, their wage, superannuation, PAYG tax, WorkCover, leave entitlements and employment agreements. 


* As the employer you are responsible for maintaining and checking Working with Children Checks. 


* We recommend obtaining a National Police Check, Working with Children Check and HTLAID004 First Aid Certificate before commencing employment. 


* As the employer you are responsible for adhering to Australian National Employment Standards, tax and superannuation legislation. 

* As the employer you are responsible for outlining the appropriate agreements and working conditions.  

* Expect a base rate of $23 per hour + 9.5% superannuation, + 1.8% WorkCover insurance. You will also need to consider insurance costs and vehicle insurance costs if your nanny is to drive. You will need to consider how to manage PAYG tax and time sheets, and any costs related to administration. The minimum base rate + these added costs come to a minimum of $26 per hour and can reach up to $45 an hour. Should you choose to use a recruitment service to recruit a nanny to employ directly you can expect placement fees between $499 and $4999.


Hiring a contractor: 
* A nanny cannot simply claim to be a contractor. It is the nature of the work and the engagement that determines whether the worker is a contractor or an employee. It’s important to clarify your needs from the beginning so you can determine your responsibilities, costs and the associated administration. It’s also important to keep tabs on the engagement as a contractor may start working more often and on a more regular basis, indicating a change to an employee/employer arrangement. 


* The nanny works for herself and is responsible for her own employment. Expect rates of at least $35 per hour for a contractor in Australia. This will include the nanny’s base rate, loading or leave, superannuation, insurance and WorkCover. A rate of $35 per hour can reflect a base rate of just $23 per hour—close to minimum wage in Australia. 


* The nanny is responsible for managing her own PAYG tax, superannuation payments and leave entitlements. 


* As her own employer, the nanny has more power to decide when to take work and when to decline work, and the conditions set for her work.


* It's very difficult to keep someone in a role that offers less than 6 hours each shift. You may need to consider extending your hours to find the right person and keep them on board long term. If you extend your hours to more than 5 hours per week you will gain the benefits of finding an experienced person who is going to last—you will also need to consider your employer obligations.
