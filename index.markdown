When we connect you with a nanny, you’ll have peace of mind knowing each nanny has been met personally and carefully vetted for experience, reliability and cultural fit. We look for:
- People over the age of 25
- Australian citizens or permanent residents
- Tertiary educated carers and teachers
- Experience working with children and families
- People who have that spark, communicate effectively and smile throughout their day
