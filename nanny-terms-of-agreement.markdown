Hi there, 

Please find our terms of agreement below. Our goal is to create a community of happy and supported nannies. We're not huge fans of legal-jargon but it is important that we understand what each of our roles entail in this working relationship. Below is your agreement with Nanny Match. You'll also complete an agreement with each family, so everyone is on the same page. 

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or queries. 

Kindness, 
Ruby and the Nanny Match team
