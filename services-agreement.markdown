**General Provisions**

You have requested Nanny Match to provide your Family with the services of a Nanny Match employee. Nanny Match is a service provider for the purposes of the Australian Consumer Law, and will provide services in accordance with this and all other relevant legislation.

Nanny Match will not themselves perform the services agreed to, but rather will supply one or more workers to fulfill your Family’s request. Nannies supplied by Nanny Match to carry out work shall at all times remain employees of Nanny Match.

The contact details for any Nanny engaged by the Family shall remain confidential. Such details shall not be made available to any other person, company, or private employer without the consent of the Nanny.

A Nanny may interview and work with multiple families. In order to facilitate this, your Family is responsible for: 

* Notifying the Nanny of any changes to your booking, and;
* Contacting the Nanny to arrange an interview.

Long term bookings will take priority over casual bookings.

Families that have completed placement reviews will take priority over all bookings.

**Casual bookings**

Your Family will be charged the casual hourly rate listed on the Nanny's profile. There is no placement fee for casual bookings.

Should your Family request to interview a nanny for a casual booking your Family will be charged an interview fee. The interview fee is a minimum of 2-hours at the Nanny's casual hourly rate.

Casual bookings require 24 hours notice of cancellation. When cancellation is made in less than 24 hours a 50% cancellation fee applies.

**Long term bookings**

There is no charge to interview nannies for long term bookings.

Long term bookings require a placement fee of $490. The placement fee is charged on confirmation of your match. 

All bookings are based on a minimum 4 hour shift length. Your family will be charged a minimum of 4 hours. 

For shifts that are longer than 4 hours, your Family will be charged for the total hours between the nanny's arrival and departure to your home or the place of care. Nannies will record their arrival and departure times using online human resources and employee management software.  

In addition to this agreement, you will also be provided with a Placement Agreement. This agreement is entered into between your Family and your Nanny and will describe the services which the Nanny will provide to your Family as agreed between you. It is your Family's responsibility to complete the Placement Agreement before services commence. Your Family will be charged casual hourly rates until the Placement Agreement is completed.

Nanny Match must be notified of any variations to this agreement negotiated between your Family and the Nanny. 

Long term bookings begin with a 4-week trial period. 

You will be provided with a Placement Review at the end of your trial period. Your Family is responsible for completing the Placement Review. 

**Payments**

Invoices are generated weekly and will be automatically charged to your nominated credit card or direct debit account within one week. A transaction fee of 1.98% (Visa/Mastercard) or 3.85% (AMEX) + 33c will be charged if paying by credit card. There is no transaction fee for direct debit. 

Services may be suspended if an account is in arrears for more than seven days. 

Your Family shall bear the legal or other costs incurred by Nanny Match to recover monies on all invoices not paid within the agreed terms. 

Nanny Match may vary its rates from time to time to include any change to any statutory on-costs, e.g. any legislative changes, public liability insurance premiums; or if there is any change which affects the cost of providing Nanny Match employees. Nanny Match will give your Family at least two weeks’ written notice of the new rates. 

The rates charged to your Family will increase by $1 per hour for each consecutive year of childcare services provided by Nanny Match. 

**Nanny Match Responsibilities**

Nanny Match is responsible for the following in relation to the Nanny:

**Absenteeism, Cancellations and Holidays**

At your Family’s request, Nanny Match will endeavour to find your Family a replacement Nanny, if the usual Nanny engaged with your Family is unable to provide care.

No pre-placement interviews will take place for Nannies engaged into temporary positions, unless your Family elects to pay the costs of the temporary Nanny attending an interview. Nanny Match charges a minimum of 2 hours per interview.

Both the Family and the Nanny will give notice of absenteeism, cancellations, and holidays as outlined in the Placement Agreement. Your Family will notify the Nanny and Nanny Match if they decide to take any holiday which would impact the Nanny’s engagement, and if taking a holiday longer than 14 days will communicate to the Nanny their agreement for: 

* The Nanny to be paid a retainer during your Family’s holiday to ensure continued commitment; or
* The Nanny to be placed with another family.

In the event that a Nanny terminates their engagement with your Family within 12 months of placement, Nanny Match will endeavour to find your Family a suitable replacement as soon as possible. An additional placement fee will not be charged to your Family if the replacement is required less than 12 months after the first placement fee was charged, and the fundamental working conditions of the engagement (including but not limited to location, working hours, number of children in care) have not changed.
