I'm a responsible, down to earth and nurturing person in my work. I have Certificate III in Children's Services, WWCC, Police Check, am trained in First Aid, CPR, Anaphylaxis and Asthma management.

When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my loved ones, going out for brunch, exercising, and going away over the weekend and visiting beautiful places in Victoria. 

I have 4.5 years of  experience in the Childcare industry both at a centre and working as a nanny. I have experience with newborns to children up to age 10. I've cared for families with one, two, three and four children, twins, triplets, children on the spectrum, and new born babies. 

I adore working with babies and children. Forming a positive relationship with the families I work with and becoming a part of the family is very rewarding.

I believe in being a nurturing, down to earth carer, with a sense of humour. Providing babies and children in my care with a environment that makes them thrive and feel safe is paramount. Making them feel as though they belong is extremely important to me. Seeing them develop from one milestone to another, and knowing that I am making a positive influence in their life inspires me to continue what I do for work. Lastly, seeing them happy in my care gives my soul great happiness!

"Libby was a blessing when I decided to go back to work and Harriet was 6 months old. She was professional, caring and so kind towards our wee girl and quickly became apart of our family. I highly recommend her! She is amazing!" Rebecca, Northcote 

"Libby has provided ongoing care for our two boys for the past 18 months (since my eldest son was 6 months old). In that time, she has proven to be incredibly reliable, diligent and caring, and overall a trusted part of our family routine. Libby has a very calm and patient disposition and allows our boys to learn at their own pace through unstructured play (with plenty of cheers of encouragement!) We could literally not have made it through the past 18 months without Libby's help and can't recommend her more highly - if I could rate her more than 5 stars I would!"â€”Belinda, Ivanhoe


"Libby looked after our family over the period of 12 months. During this time, we had another baby boy born. Libby was a fantastic support our then 19 month old throughout this huge life change. She then also helped out with out new baby, forging a close bond with him. When the little one was 4 months, I felt completely confident in leaving both boys with her while I started working again. She is empathetic, calm, organised and caring. Both boys thrived in her company and she is my ""go to"" person whenever I need someone reliable and loving to care for my children."- Allison, Reservoir VIC
