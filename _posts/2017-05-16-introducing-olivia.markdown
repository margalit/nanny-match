 "We were extremely impressed by how quickly Olivia won the affections of our children. In a matter of days they were the best of friends and the house was a happy place to return to in the evenings. There was never any question of them testing her...she had the measure of them from the start and they immediately fell in line. We returned from work to find the children in their Pj's, calm and relaxed with the kitchen immaculate. Olivia is a happy presence to have around the house. She is calm under pressure, extremely efficient and organised and wonderfully imaginative when it comes to entertaining children and cooking their meals. She is a natural around children, organizing age appropriate activities and games and insuring that they always feel secure and loved. It is rare to find a nanny who is not only mature for her age but also so intelligent, she really is the safest pair of hands a parent could hope for."

Olivia brings a Diploma of Children's services and experience as both a room leader and private nanny:


"I am a fun loving, caring and lively child carer. I bring 5 years of experience in childcare and nanny positions. I hold my Diploma in Children's Services which I completed in 2014. After I finished my diploma I moved to London for 2 years where I worked as a nanny and it was incredible. I worked for two wonderful families and really felt like part of the families I worked with. I love my job and I am a hands on nanny, offering fun and education for each child. I love to listen, play and sing a long to music and love to play sport. I played Aussie Rules football while I was over in London and I love to be active and get out and about.

I worked in Child Care Centers for 2 years while studying my diploma. During this time I was the lead educator in the 2.5 yrs to 3 yrs room and also worked with a range of children from 6 weeks to 12 years of age. Then I moved to London to work as a nanny. My first position was as a live in nanny with a little girl who was 2.5 yrs when I stated and 4 yrs when the family moved to America and I had to find a new position. I was so very lucky to find another loving family to work with for the 9 months I had remaining on my working visa. I worked as a live out nanny with 2 boys 3 yrs and 14 months when I started. 2 months before I was due to leave the UK the family I worked for welcomed a third little boy into their family who I had the joy of helping in those early months of life. Once I moved home I started work in a Goodstart Early Learning centre where I was the lead educator in the 2.5yrs to 4yrs room.

I believe in an active, hands on approach to child care. I draw inspiration from the families I have worked for and hope to work for in the future. I have been lucky to work closely with loving, fun and caring families and I love to become part of every family I work with. Nothing brings me more joy then to help children through those important early years and achieve those awesome milestones with them!"
