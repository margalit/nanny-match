A successful nanny match takes two steps. First, you need to **find** your nanny. Then you need to **pay** your nanny. 

Nanny Match takes care of the magic that is finding your perfect match. Once you have found your nanny, we'll refer you to our affiliated payroll service, [Nanny Pay](https://www.singletouchpayrollaustralia.com.au/industry/nanny-pay-household-staff).

### Why Nanny Pay?
As fair work advocates we require all families to engage with Nanny Pay. Nanny Pay helps our community feel safe, valued and committed by ensuring fair and sustainable working conditions.  

Setting up for tax, super and WorkCover is a time-consuming and confusing process. Nanny Pay makes payroll simple and affordable. They will ensure you are completely ATO and FairWork compliant. With Nanny Pay you can enjoy the benefits of nanny care without the added paperwork. 

### Who is Nanny Pay?
Nanny Pay is owned and operated by Emma Bowdler and backed by a team of registered tax agents. Nanny Pay has extensive experience in the domestic employment sector. You can [download a Nanny Pay Brochure here](https://www.singletouchpayrollaustralia.com.au/industry/nanny-pay-household-staff).

### What's the pricing plan like?  
Engaging with Nanny Pay instead of an employment will save you up to $20 per hour. You'll pay a set up fee of $165, followed by $55 per payroll process nominated weekly, fortnightly or monthly.
