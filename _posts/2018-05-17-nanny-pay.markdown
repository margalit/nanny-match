A successful nanny match takes two steps. First, you need to **find** your nanny. Then you need to **pay** your nanny. 

Nanny Match takes care of the magic that is finding your perfect match. Then we'll refer you to our affiliated payroll service, [Nanny Pay](https://www.singletouchpayrollaustralia.com.au/industry/nanny-pay-household-staff).

### Why Nanny Pay?
We are fair work advocatesâ€”Nanny Pay helps our community feel safe, valued and committed by ensuring fair and sustainable working conditions.  

Setting up for tax, super and WorkCover is a time-consuming and confusing process. Nanny Pay makes your nanny engagement simple, ATO and FairWork compliant and affordable. With Nanny Pay you can enjoy the benefits of nanny care without the extra paperwork. 

### Who is Nanny Pay?
Nanny Pay is owned and operated by Emma Bowdler and backed by a team of registered tax agents with extensive experience in the domestic employment sector. You can [download a Nanny Pay Brochure here](https://www.singletouchpayrollaustralia.com.au/industry/nanny-pay-household-staff).
