A successful nanny match takes two steps: first, you need to **find** your nanny. Then you need to **pay** your nanny. 

Nanny Match takes care of the finding part. Then, we'll refer you to our partner payroll service to help you with the **payment** part. 

**Why Nanny Pay?**
As fair work advocates, we require all families to engage with Nanny Pay. Nanny Pay helps our community feel safe, value and committed by ensuring fair and sustainable working conditions.  

Nanny Pay makes payroll simple and affordable and they will ensure you are completely ATO and FairWork compliant.

**Who is Nanny Pay?**
Nanny Pay is owned and operated by Emma Bowdler and backed by a team of registered tax agents. Nanny Pay has extensive experience in the domestic employment sector. 

**How much will it cost?** 
Engaging with Nanny Pay instead of an agency employed nanny will save you up to $20 per hour. You will pay a set up fee of $165, followed by $55 per payroll process nominated weekly, fortnightly or monthly.
