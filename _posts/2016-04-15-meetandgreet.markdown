So, you have a shortlist of interested nannies who you would like to meet. Invite each applicant over for a cuppa, give them a tour of your home and watch how they interact with your children.

* What do you enjoy most about working with children?

* Tell me about your last nanny job. What were the positives?

* What could have made your last role more fulfilling?

* Were there any negatives? How did you work through these?

* What are your interests, professional and personal?

When employing a nanny you are required to meet the employer obligations of Fair Work Act 2009. These include, negotiating and documenting an employment agreement, paying salary and providing pay advice records, submitting PAYG taxation and providing group certificates and paying superannuation and Work Cover insurance. [Fair Work Australia](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/) is a great resource.
