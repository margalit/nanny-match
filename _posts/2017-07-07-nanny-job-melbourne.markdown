**Experienced nanny required in Kensington**

8:30-1:30 two days per week, with hours expected to increase in coming months. Ad hoc evening babysitting also available.

Caring for both children in one home, this role covers feeding, nap time and play time. Neither family follows a strict schedule, but they do keep the day predictable for the little ones. 

**You'll need:**
 
* Experience caring for children under 12 months old
* Experience caring for more than one child at a time
* The ability to commit for at least 12 months
* A childcare first aid certificate or the ability to obtain one
* A working with children check or the ability to get one

**As a Nanny Match employee, you'll receive:**

* A fair nanny-share wage + superannuation
* A yearly pay rise
* Nanny insurance
* Employment contracts and placement agreements
* Automated time sheets
* Opportunities to attend nanny meet-ups, workshops and social events
