We've teamed up with [Heide MoMA](https://www.heide.com.au/) to give one lucky couple a chance to attend the next [Art by Twilight](https://www.heide.com.au/events/art-twilight-hinterlandt) event on January 27.

The prize includes a double pass to Art by Twilight, a professional nanny to care for your children while you're out and the option to book a meet-and-greet with your nanny before your date.

Featuring works by Jenny Watson, Albert Tucker, live music by Hinterlandt and childcare provided by nanny Braidicea, we're looking forward to helping a couple to reconnect through art.
