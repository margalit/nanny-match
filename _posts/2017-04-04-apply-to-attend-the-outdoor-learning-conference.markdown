We're looking for a nanny with an interest in outdoor learning—someone who can go along, soak it all in and report back to the Nanny Match community.

[The conference](http://earlychildhoodoutdoorlearning.weebly.com/ecoln-2017-conference.html) offers knowledge and practical ideas for those interested in taking children into nature and learning with Country. Key note presentations include information on research in the value of 'bush' kindergartens, a mapping project about the current state of service delivery around nature play and a community project aimed at First Peoples culture. 

* April 22, 9am – 4pm
* Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne 
* Cost: $0. It's on us.
