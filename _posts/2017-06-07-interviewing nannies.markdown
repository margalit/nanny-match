When looking for a new nanny, it's best to start advertising and meeting people. Depending on your timeline, you may choose to run phone or cafe interviews first before meeting in your home with your children. 

Some helpful questions include: 

* What do you enjoy most about working with children? 
* What are you looking for in your next family? 
* Do you have a routine that you work to? 
* What are your favourite things to do with this age group? 
* Tell me about your last nanny job. What were the positives? Were there any difficulties? How did you work through these? 
* What have you learned from your work with families? 
* What do you consider to be your strengths? 
* What are your plans for the next year or so? 
* What is your childcare philosophy? 
* Where do you draw inspiration from? 
* Do you work with other families? If so, when? 
* When are you available to work with us? 
* Do you have any changes to availability coming up? 
* Do you have any questions for us? 
* What are you looking for in your next role? 

It's also important to view the nanny's Working with Children Check and First Aid Certificate and work with the nanny to ensure these are up-to-date before the position commences.
