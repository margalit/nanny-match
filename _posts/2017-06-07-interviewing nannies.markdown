The nanny industry is fast-paced. When we find a great nanny, we have two weeks to place her before she finds another job. For parents, this means taking time to run phone interviews before investing time to meet in person. 

* Tell me about your experience with children. 
* What do you enjoy most about working with children? 
* What do you bring to your work with children?
* What was your own childhood like? 
* What are you looking for in your new job? 
* Do you have a routine that you work to? 
* What are your favourite things to do with children (ages)? 
* Tell me about your last nanny job. What were the positives? Were there any difficulties? How did you work through these? 
* What have you learned from your work with families? 
* What do you consider to be your strengths? 
* Do you have any interviews coming up? 
* What are your other commitments during the week?
* What are your plans for the next year or so? 
* Do you have any questions for me?
