Every nanny has their favourite family - welcoming, appreciative, caring, interested.

So, how do you find another amazing job? The first step is to know what you want.

Think about your favourite job/nanny family so far. What made this job so great? Make a list. Here's my list:

* I worked with like-minded parents

* The family guaranteed my hours & income

* I worked a minimum of two days per week so I was able to develop a relationship with the children and their parents

* I only cared for one or two children at a time

What was difficult about your last role? Make a list. My list looks like this:

* I didn't know at the time, but I made the mistake of asking for a low hourly rate

* I took on too many shifts

Now think about what you need. How much income do you need to pay rent? What do you need to enjoy your work? Make another list. Here's an example:

**Hours:** 24 hours per week minimum\
**Location:** Willing to travel as far north as Thornbury\
**Number of children**: 1 or 2\
**Hourly rate:** $25 \+ super \+ sick leave\
**Also:** Looking for a 12 month role

Now you have an idea of what you're looking for in a new role & new family. Collect some bangin' references, write an inspiring resume and only apply for roles that will give you what you want and what you need. If you'd like more help in knowing what you want
[my dear friend Caitlyn can help you out](http://www.sexyloveproject.com/). She's also an ex nanny!

A little note about instinct. Tap into your intuition when you meet with a new family. How do you feel in their home? Do you connect? Would your parents, brother, boyfriend, girlfriend, grandparents feel you are in the right place?

YES? Do it! Have fun. Enjoy being a part of this family.

NO? Keep looking! You'll find them.
