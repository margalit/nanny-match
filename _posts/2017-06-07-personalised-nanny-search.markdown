Finding a nanny is all about finding the **right match**. If you haven't found your match in our available nannies we can recruit a new nanny for your family. Here's how it works: 

* First, we finalise your job specs. We require a deposit of $290 to start your search.

* We advertise your job, filter applications, organise background checks and run phone and 1â€“1 interviews. We return with a shortlist of up to three candidates for you to choose from.

* You choose who to meet and either confirm your match or share feedback so we can endeavour to find a better fit. 

* We provide a Nanny + Family Agreement and set your nanny up for employment with Nanny Match. 

As we are looking for a Nanny Match employee, all candidates must meet our requirements: 

* Over 22 years of age (25+ preferred)
* Experience with children
* Australian citizen or permanent resident
* Must express a willingness to commit for at least 12 months
* Must be willing to obtain a Childcare First Aid Certificate and Working with Children Check

Of course, we meet all candidates in person so we can check for good energy and smiles. 

Please note a personalised search takes at least three weeks.
