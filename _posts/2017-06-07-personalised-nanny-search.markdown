Finding a nanny is all about finding the **right match**. When you register with Nanny Match, we'll first share our database of nannies who are available and looking for work. From here, you'll be able to contact the nannies directly and have a chat to see if it's a match.

Once you've worked through our current pool and if you're still looking for your match, we can arrange a **personalised search**. 

Here's how it works: 

* First, we finalise your job specs. We require a deposit of $290 to start your search.

* We advertise your job, filter applications, organise background checks and run phone and 1â€“1 interviews. We return with a shortlist of up to three candidates for you to choose from.

* You choose who to meet and either confirm your match or share feedback so we can endeavour to find a better fit. 

* We provide a Nanny + Family Agreement and set your nanny up for employment with Nanny Match. 

As we are looking for a Nanny Match employee, all candidates must meet our requirements: 

* Over 22 years of age (25+ preferred)
* Experience with children
* Australian citizen or permanent resident
* Must express a willingness to commit for at least 12 months
* Must be willing to obtain a Childcare First Aid Certificate and Working with Children Check

Of course, we meet all candidates in person so we can check for good energy and smiles. 

Please note a personalised search takes at least three weeks.

If you'd like to arrange a personalised search, please [get in touch](http://nannymatch.com.au/contact/) to discuss:
