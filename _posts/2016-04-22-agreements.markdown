The first step in fostering a positive nanny - family relationship is to share each other's expectations. Boil the kettle and set aside some time to sit down together. Start with an open, honest discussion and draw up an agreement.


**Some talking points**

* We need help with...

* We see this as an opportunity to...

* Our usual routine involves…

* Three words to sum up our parenting style…

* What can we do to help you enjoy your work?


**Remember to discuss**

* Start date

* Trial period

* Hourly rate


* Confidentiality


**Communication**

Nannying, like parenting, is a fluid role that changes as a child grows. I strongly recommend organising a monthly meeting to check-in and discuss any changes to the job and each other's expectations. Take the opportunity to share praise and keep a healthy relationship. It's easy to let these things slide as you are running out the door day-to-day or having a chat over a nappy-change.

Daily texts and photos keep everyone in the loop. Some parents that share little time with their nannies use communication books for notes on behaviour and changes in routines. It's a good idea to use email to schedule shifts.


**Safety**

Share emergency numbers, take your nanny on a safety tour of the house and property, book [first aid courses](http://wonderwomanchildren.com.au), discuss smoking/non-smoking, house keys and security, use of vehicles and[ insurance](http://nannysure.com.au/).


**Employment Contracts**

Here's an example of a nanny contract. Please note this is intended as a guide only.
