After completing a BA of Early Childhood Education in 2015, Sarah decided to take a step away from formal education systems and continue her work as a private nanny. She was drawn to the opportunity to form intimate in-home partnerships and the ability to work with children from infancy through to toddlerhood. She wanted to combine her skills as a caregiver and educator: [Sarah De Lean Personalised Educare](https://www.facebook.com/Sarah-de-Lean-Personalised-Educare-1116343531731344/) was born.

Sarah has borrowed the word educare from the R.I.E. philosophy of [Magda Gerber](https://www.rie.org/about/our-founder/), most commonly known from the blog of [Janet Langsbury](http://www.janetlansbury.com/), who offers practical ways for parents and carers to interact with infants and children respectfully. It means to **‘care while we educate and educate while we care.’**

Sarah also draws inspiration from [Forest Schools](http://www.forestschoolcanada.ca/uncategorized/letting-a-wrong-answer-stand) and [Reggio Emilia](http://www.aneverydaystory.com/beginners-guide-to-reggio-emilia/main-principles/). She delights her families with a **“no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing"** belief, and provides children with opportunities to develop understandings through experience and consolidate and express their ideas through art and on going research.

## Sarah's top tips for parents and carers

### 1. Slow down and observe your child

Simplify your time, get out in nature and enjoy how your child interacts with the world.

### 2. Ask questions

When a child has questions, rather than giving him/her the answer, ask questions to encourage their abilities to make observations and hypothesise. Children’s knowledge is better built by constructing the knowledge themselves with support, rather than answers relayed.

### 3. Step back and trust

Trust that children will learn what they need to know when they are ready.  Childhood isn’t a hurry. People are unique, learn at different rates and in different ways.
