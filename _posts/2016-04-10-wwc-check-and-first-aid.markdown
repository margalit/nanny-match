Nannies working in Melbourne must hold a valid [Working with Children Check](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/). The WWC Check screens a personâ€™s national criminal history and in some cases their professional conduct. The Department of Justice & Regulation continues to monitor these records for the life of each card - that's five years.

Application forms can be found at the [Victorian Government website](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/home/applications/lodging+your+application/). A WWC Check costs $116.14 and the process takes between two and three weeks.

First Aid certificates should be renewed every three years. The Australian Resuscitation Council recommends a yearly refresher course to ensure that a First Aider is able to perform CPR effectively. [WonderWoman Children](http://wonderwomanchildren.com/) offer fun, up-to-date courses for nannies and families.
