As parents find themselves without family support, working longer hours than expected and running businesses from their home office, part-time nannies are becoming more popular than full-time carers.

 
> Our nanny helps us out every Thursday. We have worked with her for two years now and I have zero regrets. I only wish that I had found someone when I was pregnant! I use this time to catch up on work, errands and spend time by myself. The support has changed my life.

>We moved to Melbourne for business, and after struggling with school pick-up and having a social life, we decided to find a nanny to work three afternoons each week. She works until 9pm every Friday and my partner and I meet for a date-night. I did not realise how relieved I would feel to know that we have someone to call on.

> Our nanny has been a life-saver. She looks after our youngest daughter every Tuesday and helps me with the school run. I spend the day working on my business with no interruptions. I can offer my children more time during the rest of the week, which was near impossible before we found our nanny!
