Your nanny-ad is what draws nannies to your familyâ€”the more attractive the ad, the more interest you'll receive.


If you're looking for a part-time nanny, they will have other commitments. It's important to share your needs with applicants so they can consider how the role will fit into their schedule. This will save you from meeting people who can't actually consider the role.


Another thing to keep in mind is that the most experienced nannies are in high demand and they often work with more than one family. A nanny can view up to 20 family-ads per day. They're looking for a family who they will connect with. It's helpful to stand out by sharing an interesting family description. These ads get five times more viewings than those that do not describe their family. 


## Three tips to attract the best nanny candidates: 
* Be clear about the days and hours you require.
* If you can offer flexibility in the days or times, mention it with clarity. 
* Tell the candidates about your family.

### 1) Be clear about the days and hours you require. 

Like this: *We are looking for a nanny to work with us on Mondays and Tuesdays from 8:30am to 4:30pm.*

Not like this: 

"Mondays."

**2) If you do have any flexibility in the days or times, mention the flexibility with clarity.

Like this: 

"We are looking for a nanny to work with us and have a preference for Mondays and Tuesdays from 8:30am to 4:30pm. We can be flexible with the hours for the right person."

Not like this: 
"Maybe on Tuesday or Monday, we aren't really sure."

3) Tell the nannies about your family. 

Like this: 
"We are a couple in our mid-thirties with one child, Jess. We moved to Melbourne from Sydney and we don't have any family here, so we're looking for support. We work in marketing and software development. We enjoy weekend play dates, brunch, exploring the city and bush walking. We appreciate music, art and good food."

Not like this: 
"Parents needing help with childcare. Two kids."
