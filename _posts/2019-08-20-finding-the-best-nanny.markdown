Your ad is what draws nannies to your family—the more attractive the ad, the more interest you'll receive.


If you're looking for a part-time nanny, you will need to consider the fact that they will have other commitments. It's important to share your needs with applicants so they can consider how the role will fit with schedule. This will save you time in the long run by avoiding candidates who can't actually consider the position.


The [most experienced nannies](https://airtable.com/shrmZjLS1Gt5I9cbh) are in high demand and often work with more than one family. A nanny can view up to 10 family-ads per day and they're looking for a good connection. You will receive more views—and a higher chance of a perfect match—if you include an interesting family description.

## Four tips to attract the best nanny candidates: 
* Be clear about the days and hours you require.
* If you can offer flexibility in the days or times, mention it. 
* Tell the candidates about your family.
* If you just want to meet the best person for your family, be open to negotiation. 

### Be clear about the days and hours you require. 


Like this: *Mondays and Tuesdays from 8:30am to 4:30pm.*


Not like this: *Mondays and Tuesdays*.


### If you have any flexibility around days or times, mention it. 


Like this: *We have a preference for Mondays and Tuesdays from 8:30am to 4:30pm. We can be flexible with the hours for the right person.*


Not like this: *Maybe on Tuesday or Monday, we aren't really sure.*


### Tell the nannies about your family. 


Like this: *We are a couple in our mid-thirties with one child, Jess. We moved to Melbourne from Sydney and we don't have any family here, so we're looking for support. We work in marketing and software development. We enjoy weekend play dates, brunch, exploring the city and bush walking. We appreciate music, art and good food.*

Not like this: *Parents needing help with childcare. Two kids.*

### If you are open to negotiation, mention it. 

Like this: *We are interested in meeting the right person for our children, and we are open to negotiation regarding hours and pay.*
