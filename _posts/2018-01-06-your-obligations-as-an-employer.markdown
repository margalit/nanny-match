**Tax file declaration**
You will need to ask your new nanny to complete a [Tax File Number Declaration Form](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/IND/Downloads/TFN_declaration_form_N3092.pdf).

* As the employer it is your obligation to ensure your nanny has a valid [Working with Children Check](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/), [first aid certificate](http://www.cbdcollege.edu.au/) and [police check](https://www.nationalcrimecheck.com.au/) to support your Nanny's application.

* Income tax
As an employer you will be required to register for [Pay As You Go] (https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/CAS/downloads/CAS_16344n3377-07-2014_registerpayg.pdf) with the Australian Taxation Office. Once registered with the ATO, you will be required to withhold the necessary tax from the Nanny’s wage and forward the withholding amounts to the ATO on a quarterly basis. 

* Have an agreement in place between you and the Nanny that states working conditions. Nanny Match can provide an agreement as a guideline. 

* Refer to [Fair Work]( https://www.fairwork.gov.au/) to ensure your obligations are being met.

* Superannuation
If you pay an employee $450 or more (before tax) in a calendar month, you have to pay super—9.5% on top of their wages. You pay super if the employee is full time, part time or casual. You have to pay super for some contractors, even if they quote an Australian business number (ABN).

* Holiday leave and sick leave: There are minimum leave entitlements for full-time and part-time employees which vary from state to state.

**Insurance**

* Domestic Workers Compensation, or household workers insurance, is essential if you employ someone in your home environment; it can be obtained at an estimated cost of $40 per year from most insurance companies and covers you in the unfortunate case of the
employee injuring themselves whilst in your home. Contact WorkCover QLD on 1300 362 128
* Public Liability Insurance to cover accidents in your home. You should check your Home and Contents insurance policy to ensure your Nanny is covered. Alternatively, you may arrange public liability insurance with an insurer such as NannySure
* Motor Vehicle Insurance if your Nanny is going to be using your car. 

**Km rate** 
If the Nanny is going to be using their own vehicle the current rate set by Fair Work is 0.66 cents per km.
