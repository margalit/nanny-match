**Tax file declaration**
You will need to ask your new nanny to complete a [Tax File Number Declaration Form](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/IND/Downloads/TFN_declaration_form_N3092.pdf).

* As the employer it is your obligation to ensure your nanny has a valid [Working with Children Check](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/), [first aid certificate](http://www.cbdcollege.edu.au/) and [police check](https://www.nationalcrimecheck.com.au/) to support your Nanny's application.

* Income tax
As an employer you will be required to register for [Pay As You Go] (https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/CAS/downloads/CAS_16344n3377-07-2014_registerpayg.pdf) with the Australian Taxation Office. Once registered with the ATO, you will be required to withhold the necessary tax from the Nanny’s wage and forward the withholding amounts to the ATO on a quarterly basis. 

* Have an agreement in place between you and the Nanny that states working conditions. Nanny Match can provide an agreement as a guideline. 

* Refer to [Fair Work]( https://www.fairwork.gov.au/) to ensure your obligations are being met.

* Superannuation
If you pay an employee $450 or more (before tax) in a calendar month, you have to pay super—9.5% on top of their wages. You pay super if the employee is full time, part time or casual. You have to pay super for some contractors, even if they quote an Australian business number (ABN).

* Holiday leave and sick leave: There are minimum leave entitlements for full-time and part-time employees which vary from state to state.

* Insurance: It’s strongly recommended that you have insurance that covers domestic employees in the event of injury in the workplace (your home) or on their way to and from work.

* Family car: If the Nanny is going to drive the family car you will need to consider your insurance policy.

* Km rate: If the Nanny is going to be using their own vehicle the current rate set by Fair Work is 0.66 cents per km.
