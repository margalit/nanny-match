**Tell us a little bit about you?**

I grew up in the north-eastern suburb of Melbourne, Eltham. I’ve lived a few other places post high-school, including overseas, but am back in Eltham now. It’s special to me. I love Eltham because of the plants, animals, stars and Yarra river. I studied visual art at university, and have continued to nurture my arts practice since graduating. I work predominantly in the mediums of photography and video. In the future, I plan to pursue my interest in child development and education, probably undertaking a Master of Teaching.

**How did you find Nanny Match?** 

I found Nanny Match through a mutual friend of Ruby's, whom I studied with at The Victorian College of the Arts. I was attracted to Nanny Match because of it’s person centred focus, strong network of passionate creatives, and Ruby’s smart, bright, brilliant and generous energy! 

**Tell us about the children you work with?**

I work with two brothers currently, both gorgeous. They continually impress me with their curiosity, and ability to understand and learn in all situations. I hope that they will always love learning and sharing this with each other!

**What do you enjoy most about your days with the boys?** 

I really enjoy it when the boys use their imaginations to create storylines for their toys and surroundings. The freedom they seem to have when doing this is beautiful, and increases their ability to be tolerant of each others needs and desires.

**What are your strengths as a nanny?** 

I believe my strengths as a nanny are patience, empathy, reasoning, and enthusiasm. 

**What does a day in the life of you look like?** 

My routine is quite flexible which I love. However, besides my afternoons with the boys, I routinely volunteer at a primary school, do dance classes, and spend time at my studio in Coburg. I also visit exhibitions, have started gardening, and spend time with my family and close friends. 

**How does nannying support the other parts of your life?** 

Nannying is wonderful, as it allows me more flexibility (along with structure), and autonomy than any job I’ve had before. I feel challenged, inspired and appreciated in my work.

**What makes a great nanny + family match?** 

I believe a great nanny and family match is built on mutual respect and understanding of each others values and challenges. It’s best to be open and caring at all times.
